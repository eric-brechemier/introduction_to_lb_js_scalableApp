1. Intro (9')
  * Layers of Responsibility
= 3 SLIDES times 3 minutes

IDEA1 = 1 YEAR ANNIVERSARY
IDEA2 = SEPARATION OF CONCERNS
IDEA3 = EVOLUTION OVER TIME: UPDATE, ADD, REMOVE MODULES

=> find picture of birthday cake
=> icons of browser logos and JavaScript libraries
=> pencil annotations on top

  * Pub/Sub
=> sketches of 1,2,3 UI/DATA module with red lines for events
=> successive pictures of the same drawing (the good scenario) - KEEP LAYERS
IDEA1 = make HIGH TECH, not SPAGHETTI
IDEA2 = 2 types of events intra-module (DOM events) and inter-module (application events)
IDEA3 = EVOLUTION OVER TIME: UPDATE, ADD, REMOVE EVENTS

  * Sandboxing
IDEA1 = WORK IN ISOLATION
IDEA2 = REDUCE INFORMATION OVERLOAD - Put your module developer hat
IDEA3 = (SLOW) EVOLUTION OVER TIME: ADD METHODS (PLUGINS) - NO UPDATE OR REMOVE, THINK TWICE BEFORE ADDING - With your framework developer hat
=> picture of a couch (developer) on top of module, Sandbox (and beyond... ?)
