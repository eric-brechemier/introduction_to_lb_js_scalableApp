GOOD PRACTICES FOR SLIDES

More slides
Less information on each
Variety and constants

Full Screen Images to illustrate a concept

Layer titles over images putting a semi-transparent black background behing the white title

ONE BIG PHRASE (not even a sentence) with ONE COLORED WORD (for highlight and fast scanning) - SAME SIZE

Dark/black background and Light/white text (easier on the eye using a projector)

Gray background with optional  *vertical* gradient instead of white which might be too bright on a screen

Smaller text and illustrations below to illustrate the message

Syntax Highlighting for code
No more than a vim window at a time ~20 lines

pencil annotations: arrows and circles and text

BAD PRACTICES
- different sizes for words in the same sentence
- different fonts, font weights, text decorations within the same sentence
- radial gradient (no sense of direction)
